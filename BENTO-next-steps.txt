BENTO: High-Impact Improvements & Next Steps
===========================================

1. Freeform Scrapbook Layout (Organic Desk)
-------------------------------------------
- Replace the grid with a freeform, draggable, and resizable card layout.
- Use a library like `react-rnd` or `react-moveable`.
- Store each card’s x, y, width, height, and rotation in state.
- Allow cards to overlap, tilt, and be placed anywhere—just like a real desk or scrapbook.

2. Organic Card Placement & Rotation
------------------------------------
- Add a small random rotation to each card on creation (e.g., between -2deg and +2deg).
- Allow users to rotate cards manually (with a handle or gesture).
- Add subtle drop shadows and depth for a tactile, layered look.

3. Media & Card Enhancements
----------------------------
- Wider aspect ratios for all media (Polaroid or film strip feel).
- Polaroid-style image cards: Add a “caption” area below images.
- Rich link previews: Fetch and display site title, favicon, and description for links.
- Audio/Video: Style players to look like cassette tapes or film reels.

4. Delightful Interactions
--------------------------
- Springy, physics-based drag and drop (Framer Motion or react-spring).
- Animated card “lift” on drag/hover.
- Animated FAB “bloom” (can be made even more playful).

5. Tag & Board Management
-------------------------
- Drag tags onto cards to assign them.
- Inline tag editing and color customization.
- Editable board name, background, and “desk surface” texture.

6. Social & Collaboration Layer (Future)
----------------------------------------
- Real-time collaboration: See other users’ cursors and card movements.
- Shareable “Stacks”: Select and share a group of overlapping cards.
- Public “Desks”: User profiles as curated public boards.
- Discovery “Cafe”: Browse other users’ desks in a cozy, inviting way.

7. Accessibility & UX Polish
----------------------------
- Keyboard navigation for FAB, cards, and modals.
- Screen reader support for all interactive elements.
- Accessible color contrast and focus states.

8. Performance & Persistence
----------------------------
- Persist cards and layout in localStorage or a backend (Supabase, Firebase, etc.).
- Optimistic UI updates for a snappy feel.
